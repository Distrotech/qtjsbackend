This repository contains a copy of V8 with additional changes needed for Qt.

Please use [V8] as prefix to the subject of your commit messages when your change
affects V8 itself and not the build system around it.

Updating v8:

1) Reset src/3rdparty/v8 to a V8 commit of your choice, for example:

    git fetch https://github.com/v8/v8.git refs/tags/3.7.2
    git rm --cached -r src/3rdparty/v8
    git read-tree --prefix=src/3rdparty/v8 FETCH_HEAD
    git checkout src/3rdparty/v8
    git commit

2) Cherry-pick our modifications from before:

    gitk src/3rdparty/v8

   and then cherry-pick the changes since the last v8 import.
